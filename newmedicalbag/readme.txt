The following pages can be found online at new.themedicalbag.com, but requires a user id and password.
I want to present a few pages from this website to demonstrate my Javascript skills: brand_page, search_results, edit_profile, and myaccount.  These files contain only the code that I contributed to the project, which is mostly Handlebars and Javascript.  JQuery plugins for form validation and input field formatting are used on 'myaccount' page.

My latest work is in the files that start with "brand_page".  Please start with those since they area the latest in the evolution of my development experience.  I also corrected code patterns that were used in the other files, especially the Javascript code.

Each page has the same document ready function.  And only 1 document ready function that calls only 2 functions.  The first is to execute code that is necessary for all pages on the site, pdone.site.docReady();  The second is to execute code that is specific for each page, pdone.page.docReady();

Commonly used javascript functions are saved in the 'sitewide.js' file.  It was shared by the entire team, but I tried to use the DRY principles as much as possible.

The Javascript namespace 'storage' is used as a replacement for global variables which is used to add data generated on the server.  JSON is used extensively as a data format and structure to organize code.
Each page has a similar pattern of code.
 1 Ajax requests for JSON data are performed.
 2 Content is generated by applying Handlebars and helpers.
 3 Events are attached unobtrusively to the elements on the page.

I have to admit that this project would be an ideal candidate for a single page application using Angular, Backbone, or Knockout.  It would also have benefited from Less CSS.  Mixins and variables could have eliminated redundant code for styling similar content.
