I coded the entire page and want to present it to you to represent a unique JQuery plugin that I implemented for this project.  The UX/Designer found it and liked the randomizing feature that it provided.  I worked on implementing it with our CMS that extracts the stories using an RSS feed on the server.

The most important code feature that I want to point out is the CSS.  There are no browser specific overrides to make it work.  The styling code is cross browser compatible across Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer (all the way down to IE7).

Please note the Javascript namespace 'blog'.  You will see this implemented across all of my projects.
I like using it to avoid the naming collisions.  It also helps to organize sections of code.
